This makes it difficult to host the blogs without rendering the `qmd`. I wanted this to be the case so that we could instead display already knit files as opposed to having them re-knit on a push.\n\n## Demonstration for DSPG\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(\n  \"I'll be using this code as a demonstration\"\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"I'll be using this code as a demonstration\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(\n  \"This will not print an output in my demonstration\"\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\npy = \"python\"\nprint(f\"This one is {py}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThis one is python\n```\n:::\n:::\n",

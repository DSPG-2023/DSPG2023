## Introduction

Week one for me was all about setting up the logistics for my individual groceries team as well as getting the rest of the student-based logistics set out for DSPG.

An important lesson I learned in trying to set up the Quarto webpage is that the `docs` folder needs to be re-rendering the `index.html` file alongside the individual blog files. This makes it difficult to host the blogs without rendering the `qmd`. I wanted this to be the case so that we could instead display already knit files as opposed to having them re-knit on a push.

## Demonstration for DSPG

```{r}
print(
  "I'll be using this code as a demonstration"
)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
print(
  "This will not print an output in my demonstration"
  )
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
print(
  "This won't even show up!!"
)
```

```{python}
py = "python"
print(f"This one is {py}")
```

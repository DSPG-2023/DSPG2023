In the second week, we focused on using `tidycensus` to get better at using the API for our research.

Here's an example pulling the table for all the public commuters in Iowa.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidycensus)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(sf)
```

```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE}
commuters_all <- get_acs(year = 2021, 
                    geography = "tract",
                    state = 19,
                    variables = c(Total = "B08006_011", Male = "B08006_028", Female = "B08006_045"), 
                    geometry = TRUE)
```

```{r}
commuters_all %>%
  filter(estimate > 0) %>% as.data.frame() %>%
  select(-"GEOID",-"geometry")
```

    "text": "Dev’s Work\nMonday- Collecting data for the project and working on finding data sources for Heirloom Tomatoes.\nTuesday- Collected in person data at Slater to analyze the housing conditions and amenities there in the first half of the day. Second half was remote where I worked on compiling and cleaning the data.\nWednesday- Created a script which cleaned scraped prices from Fareway Market website for locations Ames, Fort Dodge, Davenport, Iowa City, New Hampton, Clear Lake, Sioux City, Shenandoah in Iowa.\nThursday- Worked to get more data output, discussed presentation and blog wrap ups with team.\n\n\n\nThe project aims to address the need for localized and up-to-date demand forecasting information for Iowa’s local food producers.\nBy combining data and utilizing AI, the project seeks to develop a prototype application that will provide valuable insights to aid producers in making informed decisions about pricing, crop planning, and value-added processing.\nOver the course of three years, the project will progressively build upon previous work, incorporating data from various sources such as historical sales, weather patterns, and market trends.\nThe ultimate goal is to create a user-friendly tool that empowers farmers with the best information available for improving their local food business and making it more sustainable.\n\n\nPratham’s work\nProblem Statement:\n\n“The primary issue at hand is the lack of reliable demand information for local food producers in Iowa, which poses significant challenges in setting optimal prices and planning their operations effectively.”\n\n“Iowa’s local food producers lack reliable demand information, hindering their pricing and planning decisions. Our project uses AI and data analysis to develop an app that helps farmers forecast demand by considering sales history, weather, and local events. We aim to empower farmers with better decision-making tools and enhance the availability of local food in Iowa.”\n\nIn response, our project employs cutting-edge artificial intelligence and advanced data analysis techniques to develop a sophisticated application.\nThis application serves as a valuable tool for farmers, enabling them to make accurate demand forecasts by considering critical factors such as historical sales data, weather patterns, and local events.\nBy equipping farmers with enhanced decision-making capabilities, our goal is to empower them and facilitate the wider availability of locally produced food across Iowa.\n\n\n\nAaron’s Work\nThis is the scraper for Fresh Thyme Market using scrapy python package\n\n\nfrom datetime import datetime\\\n\nimport pandas as

The collected data will undergo preprocessing tasks such as cleaning, transforming, and formatting to ensure its suitability for analysis and modeling. \n\nWeek 5: (Next Week): Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering \n\nIn the upcoming week, the team will perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the collected data. Statistical techniques and visualization methods will be employed to understand the distribution, patterns, and relationships within the data. Feature engineering techniques will also be applied to extract relevant features and create new variables that enhance the predictive power of the model. \n\nWeek 6: Model Development - Building and Training the Machine Learning Model \n\nFollowing the exploratory data analysis, the team will move on to developing the machine learning model for demand forecasting. Suitable algorithms will be selected based on the problem’s nature and the available data. The chosen model(s) will be implemented and trained using the preprocessed data, with model parameters fine-tuned for optimal performance. \n\nWeek 7: Model Evaluation, Fine-tuning, and Validation \n\nDuring this phase, the trained models will be rigorously evaluated to measure their performance and predictive capabilities. Various evaluation metrics will be calculated to assess the model’s effectiveness. The team will further fine-tune the model, adjusting parameters or exploring ensemble techniques to improve its performance. Validation techniques, such as holdout sets or cross-validation, will be employed to ensure the model’s generalizability and reliability. \n\nWeek 8: Final Testing, Presentation Preparation, and Documentation \n\nIn the final week, the developed model will undergo thorough testing to ensure its stability and accuracy in predicting demand for local food products. The team will prepare a comprehensive presentation summarizing the project’s objectives, methodology, findings, and recommendations. Documentation of the project, including the data collection process, preprocessing steps, modeling techniques, and results, will also be completed. \n These future and next steps will allow the team to progress through the remaining weeks, effectively building and evaluating the machine learning model for demand forecasting in the local food industry. \nFuture scope:  \nthe future scope of the project lies in expanding the application’s capabilities, incorporating additional data sources, refining the machine learning models, and fostering collaboration within the local food ecosystem. By continually improving and adapting the solution, the project can contribute to the sustainable growth and success of Iowa’s local food producers."

    "text": "The project aims to address the need for localized and up-to-date demand forecasting information for Iowa’s local food producers.\nBy combining data and utilizing AI, the project seeks to develop a prototype application that will provide valuable insights to aid producers in making informed decisions about pricing, crop planning, and value-added processing.\nOver the course of three years, the project will progressively build upon previous work, incorporating data from various sources such as historical sales, weather patterns, and market trends.\nThe ultimate goal is to create a user-friendly tool that empowers farmers with the best information available for improving their local food business and making it more sustainable.\n\n\nPratham’s work\nProblem Statement:\n\n“The primary issue at hand is the lack of reliable demand information for local food producers in Iowa, which poses significant challenges in setting optimal prices and planning their operations effectively.”\n\n“Iowa’s local food producers lack reliable demand information, hindering their pricing and planning decisions. Our project uses AI and data analysis to develop an app that helps farmers forecast demand by considering sales history, weather, and local events. We aim to empower farmers with better decision-making tools and enhance the availability of local food in Iowa.”\n\nIn response, our project employs cutting-edge artificial intelligence and advanced data analysis techniques to develop a sophisticated application.\nThis application serves as a valuable tool for farmers, enabling them to make accurate demand forecasts by considering critical factors such as historical sales data, weather patterns, and local events.\nBy equipping farmers with enhanced decision-making capabilities, our goal is to empower them and facilitate the wider availability of locally produced food across Iowa.\n\n\n\nAaron’s Work\nThis is the scraper for Fresh Thyme Market using scrapy python package\n\n\nfrom datetime import datetime\\\n\nimport pandas as

The collected data will undergo preprocessing tasks such as cleaning, transforming, and formatting to ensure its suitability for analysis and modeling. \n\nWeek 5: (Next Week): Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering \n\nIn the upcoming week, the team will perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the collected data. Statistical techniques and visualization methods will be employed to understand the distribution, patterns, and relationships within the data. Feature engineering techniques will also be applied to extract relevant features and create new variables that enhance the predictive power of the model. \n\nWeek 6: Model Development - Building and Training the Machine Learning Model \n\nFollowing the exploratory data analysis, the team will move on to developing the machine learning model for demand forecasting. Suitable algorithms will be selected based on the problem’s nature and the available data. The chosen model(s) will be implemented and trained using the preprocessed data, with model parameters fine-tuned for optimal performance. \n\nWeek 7: Model Evaluation, Fine-tuning, and Validation \n\nDuring this phase, the trained models will be rigorously evaluated to measure their performance and predictive capabilities. Various evaluation metrics will be calculated to assess the model’s effectiveness. The team will further fine-tune the model, adjusting parameters or exploring ensemble techniques to improve its performance. Validation techniques, such as holdout sets or cross-validation, will be employed to ensure the model’s generalizability and reliability. \n\nWeek 8: Final Testing, Presentation Preparation, and Documentation \n\nIn the final week, the developed model will undergo thorough testing to ensure its stability and accuracy in predicting demand for local food products. The team will prepare a comprehensive presentation summarizing the project’s objectives, methodology, findings, and recommendations. Documentation of the project, including the data collection process, preprocessing steps, modeling techniques, and results, will also be completed. \n These future and next steps will allow the team to progress through the remaining weeks, effectively building and evaluating the machine learning model for demand forecasting in the local food industry. \nFuture scope:  \nthe future scope of the project lies in expanding the application’s capabilities, incorporating additional data sources, refining the machine learning models, and fostering collaboration within the local food ecosystem. By continually improving and adapting the solution, the project can contribute to the sustainable growth and success of Iowa’s local food producers."

    "text": "Project Overview\nOur group’s task in the 2023 DSPG program is to develop a tool for the Farm, Food and Enterprise Development ISU Extension (FFED) that can help inform decision making for rural grocery stores. The goal of the project is to help users to make better decisions in opening, inheriting, and operating grocery stores in rural environments. The development of the tool relies heavily on the research conducted by domain experts on rural grocery stores and accessibility to verified data on the topic. Our current workflow moving forward is outlined in the following manner.\n\n\n\nWeekly Project Timeline\n\n\nAs we learn more about our data and possibilities for automating processes that our client’s initially calculated manually, we update our vision for what our final deliverable for DSPG could be. A draft of our thoughts are depicted as a tool which takes a certain range of user input and automated data, transforms that data through converted functions, and outputs the results in the most accessible format for the user.\n\n\n\nTool Processes"

    "text": "Problem Statement\nThe absence of a comprehensive and unbiased assessment of housing quality in rural communities poses challenges in identifying financing gaps and effectively allocating resources for housing improvement. Consequently, this hinders the overall well-being and health of residents, impacts workforce stability, diminishes rural vitality, and undermines the economic growth of Iowa. Moreover, the subjective nature of evaluating existing housing conditions and the limited availability of resources for thorough investigations further compound the problem. To address these challenges, there is a pressing need for an AI-driven approach that can provide a more accurate and objective evaluation of housing quality, identify financing gaps, and optimize the allocation of local, state, and federal funds to maximize community benefits.\nUtilizing web scraping techniques to collect images of houses from various assessor websites, an AI model can be developed to analyze and categorize housing features into good or poor quality. This can enable targeted investment strategies. It allows for the identification of houses in need of improvement and determines the areas where financial resources should be directed. By leveraging AI technology in this manner, the project seeks to streamline the housing evaluation process, eliminate subjective biases, and facilitate informed decision-making for housing investment and development initiatives in rural communities"

    "text": "Our Progress\nWe have been making good progress to complete the goals and objectives we outlined above. Since the beginning of the Data Science for the Public Good Program, we have been expanding our knowledge of data science, particularly in areas that relate to this housing project. We have been learning and covering new concepts through Data Camp. We have also watched two webinars on TidyCensus training, as well as started creating AI Models to practice with.\n\nData Camp Training:\n\nGitHub Concepts\nAI Fundamentals\nIntroduction to R\nIntermediate R\nIntroduction to the Tidyverse\nWeb Scraping in R\nIntroduction to Deep Learning with Keras\n\n\n\nTidyCensus Demographic Data Collection:\nOne of the first steps in our project was to explore the available demographic data in our selected cities and counties. We thought it valuable to understand the demographic data, and we have represented in the plots below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating Test AI Models:\nThe next step was creating an AI Model. We decided to create an AI Model early in the project before finishing the housing data collection so that we had a better understanding when it came to putting everything together. The AI Model below tests for vegetation in front of houses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Week:\n\nIn-Person Data Collection\nOn Tuesday this week, the entire DSPG program went to Slater to practice data collection in person. The housing group took this as an opportunity to collect some housing photos on the ground to use in our AI Model later on.\n\n\nGoogle Street View and URLs\nWe are getting the majority of our photos for the AI to use from Google Street View. Google has an API key that you can use to generate an image for a specific address. We spent the first half of this week pulling addresses from each of our cities and creating URLs to pull the images from Google Street View.\nWe ran into a couple of problems when doing this, the biggest of which is displayed in the images below. Because we are working with cities in rural areas, there is not Google Street View images available for every street in our cities.\n\n\n\nGoogle Street View information for Grundy Center, Iowa. For reference, population was 2,811 as of 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Street View information for Slater, Iowa. For reference, population was 1,639 as of 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Street View information for Independence, Iowa. For reference, population was 6,307 as of 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Street View information for New Hampton, Iowa. For reference, population was 3,368 as of 2023.\n\n\nBelow is a sample from the tables we created containing the URLs to grab the images from Google Street View.\n\n\n\n\nWeb Scraping\nOnce we were finished collecting addresses and generating URLs, we moved on to scraping the web for more images. We decided to grab images from Zillow, Realtors.com, and the county assessor pages for our cities. We were able to successfully scrape images from Zillow this week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHappies\n\nCompleted a succesful meeting with Erin Olson-Douglas\nFinished collecting and creating URL addresses for Google Street View images\nSince Zillow owns Trulia so we don’t have to web scrape both sites :)\nSuccessfully scraped portions of data from Zillow !\n\n\n\nCrappies\n\nWeb Scraping\nBeacon and Vanguard have anti-web scraping protections\nAngelina’s Excel doesn’t operate as expected"

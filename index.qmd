This Quarto website is an experimental page hosting project documentation through blogs for the 2023 Data Science for Public Good program at Iowa State University. The `Blogs` tab contains the documentation for each team's work on a weekly basis. Week One is omitted since it was individual training and work beyond Week Eight is reflected in the final presentation blogs for each team.

To learn more about the program, follow the link to the [Iowa State University DSPG Program](https://dspg.iastate.edu/2023-projects).
